### Original Set Game ###
- [This game already exists online!][sg] 
- I am working on this project for the learning experience.
- You can play my version [here][myst].  
  (Thanks to [Vinietskyzilla][vz] for writing every git command out for me to make this live version available!)

### Current Features ###
- One player only
- Hint function
   - Adds new cards if no sets are available
   - Submits set after a couple extra clicks
- Works/looks best on chrome
   - Still reasonably playable on mobile browsers!

### Known Issues ###
- Hint function doesn't restart if no selected ; player deselects hint

### Incomplete / Unstarted Features ###
- Computer player (time based + rand? search from opposite end of cards from hint function)
- Multiplayer local? (listen to keyboard & each player has a button that means set?)
- Multiplayer web?
- Better color changing options
   - Change just the gradients
   - Dark vs. light color schemes
   - Maybe little boxes to show colors instead of text description
